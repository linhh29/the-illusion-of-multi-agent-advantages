base = """
Please solve the given question by creating one or more agents and connecting them into a valid computational graph that collaboratively produces the final answer. To create an agent, you must define that agent by outputting <agent> with agent_id (a unique id for the agent, must be unique and contain only alphanumeric or underscore characters (e.g., A1, Refine_1, WS_Japan)), agent_name (exactly one of: CoTAgent, SCAgent, DebateAgent, or ReflexionAgent), agent_description, required_arguments (must include at least one <agent_input> tag. DebateAgents must define <debate_roles> with two or more roles. If  <agent_input> left empty (""), the parser will automatically replace it with the original question.). 

After defining all agents, you must build a valid graph by specifying edges that describe the data flow between agents. Output exactly one <edge> block, Each <from> <to> pair connects the output of one agent to the input of another: 

<edge>
<from>source_agent_id</from>
<to>target_agent_id</to>
</edge>

You can output multiple <from> and </to> inside the <edge>. Each <from> and <to> value must exactly match an existing <agent_id>.

To be valid, your graph must satisfy all of the following constraints:

1. Node consistency: Every <from> and <to> must reference a valid <agent_id> that appears in an <agent> block.
2. Directionality: Edges are directed: data flows from <from> → <to>.
3. Connectivity: Every agent must be connected directly or indirectly to the main flow. Isolated agents are not allowed.
4. Start node(s): At least one agent must have no incoming edge. These are “entry points” (e.g., initial reasoning).
5. Sink node: There must be exactly one agent with no outgoing edge — this is the FINAL agent that produces the answer.
6. No undefined edges: It is invalid to reference an agent in <from> or <to> that was not declared.
7. No loops or cycles: No self-loop: <from>X</from><to>X</to> is not allowed. No cycles: The graph must be acyclic; a topological order must exist.
8. Parallelism allowed: Multiple agents may have the same <from> or <to> (fan-out/fan-in).
9. Unambiguous sink: The parser will reject graphs with multiple sinks (add a final “collector” agent if needed).
10. Order-independent: The XML order of edges does not need to follow execution order; topological sorting is handled automatically.
11. Sink answer completeness: The unique sink agent's output must directly answer the original question in a user-ready form. It must not be an intermediate artifact (e.g., notes, critique, raw table) unless the question explicitly asks for that artifact. If <agent_input> is empty for the sink, it inherits the original question and must return the final answer. If <agent_input> is non-empty, the runner still prepends the original question as context; the sink must still produce the final, user-facing answer to that question.
12. Edge-Data Flow Consistency (BIDIRECTIONAL): Edges represent execution order. ${} represents data flow. As a result, you must ensure they are consistent with each other.
    a) If an <agent_input> references ${X}, there MUST be an edge <from>X</from><to>THIS_AGENT</to>
    b) If there is an edge <from>X</from><to>Y</to>, then Y's <agent_input> MUST reference ${X}
    In other words: edges exist if and only if there is actual data passing from one agent to another. Do not create edges solely for execution ordering without data flow.

Thinking Section (Required):

Before defining agents and edges, you must include a <thinking> section.
It should naturally describe why multiple agents are needed, why each type was chosen, and why the graph has that structure (parallel, sequential or hybrid).
It must justify both planning and design rationale.

Example structure:

<thinking>
  Explain why a single agent is insufficient.
  Describe each agent's role and how they connect.
  Justify the flow pattern (parallel, sequential, hybrid).
  End by clearly stating which agent produces the final output.
</thinking>


Single-agent example:

If you decide to solve via single agent, you will output the following. In this case, since the agent_input is the same as the original task, you must set the agent_input as empty (""), and the parser will replace it with the original question.

1st example:

Question: Compute the definite integral of (2x + 5) dx from 0 to 3.

  <thinking>
    This problem involves symbolic integration and applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
    It requires structured reasoning rather than simple numeric computation.
    I will use a calculus agent that can perform step-by-step Chain-of-Thought reasoning.
    The final answer to the original question will be the output of the CoTAgent.

  </agent>

2nd example:

Question: What is 17 cubed?

  <thinking>
    Computing 17³ can be done directly, but arithmetic mistakes are easy to make.
    Using a Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT_SC) allows sampling multiple reasoning paths and combining results for accuracy.
    The final answer to the original question will be the output of the SCAgent.

3rd examples:

Question: Given x² = 46.694444, which target number is closer, 45 or 46?

<thinking>
  This question requires comparison between two close numeric choices.
  To ensure accuracy, I will let two reasoning roles debate — one focusing on mathematical precision and the other on practical rounding.
  The DebateAgent can capture both perspectives and reach a justified final answer.
  The final answer will be the output of the DebateAgent.

4th example:

Question: A train travels 60 miles per hour. How far does it go in 2.5 hours?

<thinking>
  This task requires reasoning with a formula and ensuring units are handled correctly.
  I will use a Reflexion agent that can reflect on and refine its reasoning if errors occur.
  The final answer to the original question will be the output of the ReflexionAgent.

</thinking>

  <agent_id>reflexion_agent</agent_id>

    </required_arguments>
</agent>

5th example:

Question: What is the current inflation rate in Japan as of this month?

<thinking>
  This question depends on up-to-date factual information that cannot be reliably recalled from static knowledge.  
  Using a single CoTAgent is sufficient because the task only requires retrieving accurate, cited facts from the web, not further reasoning or synthesis.  
  The agent will search online sources and return a concise, citation-based summary.  
  The CoTAgent is therefore both the only node and the final output of the flow.

  </required_arguments>
</agent>

Multi-Agent Example: 

If you decide to solve via multiple agents, you must first decompose the original question into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each representing a single sub-goal. Then, create one agent per sub-task and connect them into a coherent, acyclic computational graph.

In this case, the agent_input is not empty and serves as the specific sub-task for the agent to solve, while the parser automatically prepends the original question as context before the provided agent_input content.

When decomposing:

1. Keep sub-tasks minimal and focused. Each agent should handle one atomic objective (e.g., one query, one reasoning step, or one verification task).
2. Use multiple CoTAgents for different pieces of factual evidence, rather than a single broad search.
3. Connect agents logically so that information flows toward a single final agent (the sink) that directly answers the original question.


1st example:

Question: Give a short, cited summary of the most recent housing vacancy rates for New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago

<thinking>
  We need parallel reasoning passes, so we will run three CoT agents in parallel.
  Then a CoT agent will normalize the three snippets into a small table.
  An SC agent will run small variants and vote to reduce extraction errors.
  A Reflexion agent will check units, recency, and citations.
  A final CoT agent will write the short summary.
  The final sink is FINAL.

2nd example:
Question: During Pope John Paul II's first foreign journey in the late 1970s, he visited a country known for its rich Mesoamerican history and home to a large population. On which other date did he visit a major city on the Adriatic Sea, known for its significant port and a famous basilica dedicated to a saint with the initial “S”, and which other nearby city did he visit on the same day?

<thinking>
  The question needs historical reasoning: identify Pope John Paul II's first foreign trip, find an Adriatic city he visited with a basilica of a saint starting with “S”, get the date, and determine another city visited the same day.
  
  One agent cannot do all of this because it mixes retrieval and reasoning.  
  I will decompose it into smaller sub-tasks: three CoTAgents for each factual lookup, one CoTAgent to build a timeline, one ReflexionAgent to verify consistency, and a final CoTAgent to write the answer.  
  The FINAL agent outputs the final answer.

3rd example:

Question: Based on economic data, which region (Asia or Europe) is currently leading in green energy investment?

<thinking>
  This task requires retrieving multiple data sources, performing region-specific analysis, comparing them, and ensuring factual coherence.  
  A single agent might provide a rough answer but would likely mix fabricated numbers with true ones.  
  I will therefore design a diamond-shaped multi-agent graph for balanced analysis and verification.

  One CoTAgent will gather data from multiple global sources.  
  Two CoTAgents will independently analyze the data for Asia and Europe, each focusing on investment scale and growth rate.  
  Their outputs will merge in a DebateAgent that compares the two sides and recommends the leading region.  
  A ReflexionAgent will audit that recommendation for factual alignment with the original search data.  
  Finally, a CoTAgent will synthesize the audit and recommendation into the final answer.  
  The structure forms a diamond: a single source branches into two analyses, converges via debate, splits for verification, and merges again for the final synthesis.  
  The final answer comes from the FINAL agent.

4th example:

Question: Estimate annual CO₂ reduction if 1,000 gasoline taxis switch to EVs, using recent grid intensity.

<thinking>
  This estimate needs recent factual factors and careful arithmetic. A single agent could try to search and compute in one pass, but that risks using stale figures and mixing retrieval with calculation errors. 
  I will split responsibilities: two CoTAgents retrieve the latest grid CO₂ intensity (gCO₂/kWh) and a credible gasoline tailpipe factor (gCO₂/mile), with citations. A CoTAgent will state two explicit assumptions (miles per taxi per year and EV kWh per mile) because these are context-dependent and not fixed in a single source. 
  Another CoTAgent will then perform the full calculation for 1,000 taxis using the retrieved factors and stated assumptions, showing the intermediate terms so the math can be checked. 
  To make the result robust, an SCAgent will generate small variants (±10% on the two assumptions) and vote for a single number. A ReflexionAgent will audit units, sanity (e.g., non-negative, plausible scale), and consistency with the cited factors. 
  Finally, a CoTAgent will write a concise paragraph reporting the reduction, the assumptions, and both citations. The searches and assumptions can run in parallel; the calculation, vote, audit, and final write-up are sequential because each depends on the prior outputs. The final sink is FINAL.

  <agent_name>CoTAgent</agent_name>
  <required_arguments><agent_input></agent_input></required_arguments>
</agent>

<edge>
  <from>A</from><to>FINAL</to>
</edge>
4. At Least One Start Node:	At least one agent has no incoming edge (e.g., initial reasoning).
5. Exactly One Sink Node	Exactly one agent has no outgoing edge — this is the final output (sink). Bellow is WRONG as there are two sink nodes (B and C):
<edge>
  <from>A</from><to>B</to>
  <from>A</from><to>C</to>
</edge>
6. No Dangling Edges:	Every <from> and <to> exactly matches an existing <agent_id>. Bellow is WRONG as B is not an existing <agent_id>: 
<agent>
  <agent_id>A</agent_id>
  <agent_name>CoTAgent</agent_name>
  <agent_description>...</agent_description>
  <required_arguments><agent_input></agent_input></required_arguments>
</agent>

<edge>
  <from>A</from><to>B</to>
</edge>
7. No Duplicates in Edges: Do not define the same <from> <to> link twice. Bellow is WRONG as it defines the same <from> <to> link twice:
<edge>
  <from>A</from><to>B</to>
  <from>A</from><to>B</to>
</edge>
8. Parallel Allowed	Fan-out and fan-in are fine (e.g., multiple <from>s into one <to>).
9. Edge-Data Flow Consistency: Every edge must correspond to actual data flow. If <from>X</from><to>Y</to> exists, then Y's <agent_input> MUST include ${X}. Conversely, if Y uses ${X}, you MUST have an edge <from>X</from><to>Y</to>. Below is WRONG because edge C→D exists but D doesn't use ${C}:
<agent>
  <agent_id>C</agent_id>
  <agent_name>CoTAgent</agent_name>
  <required_arguments><agent_input>Analyze data.</agent_input></required_arguments>
</agent>
<agent>
  <agent_id>D</agent_id>
  <agent_name>CoTAgent</agent_name>
  <required_arguments><agent_input>Make final decision.</agent_input></required_arguments>
</agent>
<edge>
  <from>C</from><to>D</to>
</edge>
The correct version should have D use ${C}: <agent_input>Make final decision based on: ${C}</agent_input>
10. Consistent Agent Types:	Each agent uses only one of the allowed names: CoTAgent, SCAgent, DebateAgent, or ReflexionAgent.
11. No Self-Loops: Never link an agent to itself. No Cycles: The graph must be a DAG (topological order exists). Bellow is WRONG as there is a cycle (A -> B -> C -> A) and cycle (REFLECT -> REFLECT):
<edge>
  <from>A</from><to>B</to>
  <from>B</from><to>C</to>
  <from>C</from><to>A</to>
  <from>REFLECT</from><to>REFLECT</to>
</edge>
