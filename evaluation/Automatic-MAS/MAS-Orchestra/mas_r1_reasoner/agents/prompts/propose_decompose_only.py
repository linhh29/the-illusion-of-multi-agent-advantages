    # for example:
    # you cannot call 'COT' but you have to implement it eactly the same as the code in the Discovered architecture archive. Make sure you ACTUALLY IMPLEMENET them
    # You should always use CoT to address each of the sub-task.

    # (2) To creat an agent, call the LLMAgentBase, must have 'model=self.node_model' in the parameters
    # the return of the call is always the same as the output fields,
    # for example: 
    # reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent', model=self.node_model)

    # (3) Since the agent is handling with a sub_question made by question decomposition, use 'is_sub_task=True' when calling the agent.

    # (4) You need to specify the sub-task dependencies by specify the dependent sub-tasks in the instruction. You also need to give each sub-task an ID. This means you need to state clearly what the current sub-task is based on and also give all required information (thinking and answer) in the input task info
    # for example:
    # cot_instruction = ("Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2.....")

When you do self.make_final_answer, please also add `sub_tasks` as the second last parameterss

    # (6) You need to keep track of agent, for each agent inside the sub-architecture (or block or node) output, please append it to a list named `agents` (please initialize it as `agents = []` at the beining of your function) so that we can keep track of the performance of each agents. It should contain the agent name (if setting is important to identify the agent, please include as well, e.g., round, ID), agent purpose, and the thinking and output of the agent. When you do self.make_final_answer, please also add `agents` as the last parameterss

    # cot_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Chain-of-Thought Agent', model=self.node_model, temperature=0.5)

    # (7) Put the saved sub_tasks and agents to the final elf.make_final_answer.

base = f"""# Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like 'output exactly the following...' is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and 'Based on (task i)' in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2's instruction should be
'Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1's instruction)'

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3's instruction should be
'Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3's instruction)'
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states 'based on what sub-tasks'

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, always use CoT to address each of them. 


IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.


Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the 'code' entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, alwasy use CoT to address each of the sub-task.


{util_code}

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be ("thought"), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the "(thought)" section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use '->' for connection. for example, 'CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -> LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)' means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key ("name") corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key ("code") corresponds to the exact "forward()" function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in "code": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add 'sub_task=True' when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

[EXAMPLE]

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON'T try to use some function that doesn't exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM's role and temperature to further control the LLM's response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of "Infos". You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.

# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.
